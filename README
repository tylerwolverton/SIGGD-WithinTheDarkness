My contributions can be seen in the subfolder Game\Acting. 
Files I wrote:
Player.cs  <-- many people worked on this, I specifically wrote the magic attacks, special sword attack, and miscellaneous other components
Bosses\MrHammer.cs
Enemies\DiscoBlob.cs
Enemies\Octo.cs
Enemies\Sentinel.cs
Enemies\Spikon.cs

I also imported most of the enemy sprites and wired them up to their respective actors and helped design our final level for the game.
